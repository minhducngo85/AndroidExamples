There are three ways to implement a dialog in Android:
	1) Using the Dialog class (or its extensions) — In addition
	to the general-purpose AlertDialog class, Android
	includes a number of classes that extend Dialog . Each
	is designed to provide specifi c dialog-box functionality.
	A Dialog class-based screen is constructed and con-
	trolled entirely within its calling Activity, so it doesn’t
	need to be registered in the manifest.
	
	2) Dialog-themed Activities — You can apply the dialog
	theme to a regular Activity to give it the appearance of
	a standard dialog box.
	
	3) Toasts — Toasts are special nonmodal transient mes-
	sage boxes, often used by Broadcast Receivers and
	Services to notify users of events occurring in the back-
	ground. You learn more about Toasts in the section

	
Toasts are transient notification that remain visible for only a few seconds before fading out.
Toasts are perfect for informing users when one of your activities is active

Notification:
Your app can use the notification to alert users without one of its activities being visible.
Notifications are handled by the Notification Manager and currently have the ability to
	1) Display a status bar icon
	2) Flash the lights/LEDs
	3) Vibrate the phone
	4) Sound audible alerts (ringtones, Media Store audio)
	5) Display additional information within the notification tray
	6) Broadcast Intents using interactive controls from within the notification tray

Notifications are preferred mechanism for invisible application.
