There are three ways to implement a dialog in Android:
	1) Using the Dialog class (or its extensions) — In addition
	to the general-purpose AlertDialog class, Android
	includes a number of classes that extend Dialog . Each
	is designed to provide specifi c dialog-box functionality.
	A Dialog class-based screen is constructed and con-
	trolled entirely within its calling Activity, so it doesn’t
	need to be registered in the manifest.
	2) Dialog-themed Activities — You can apply the dialog
	theme to a regular Activity to give it the appearance of
	a standard dialog box.
	3) Toasts — Toasts are special nonmodal transient mes-
	sage boxes, often used by Broadcast Receivers and
	Services to notify users of events occurring in the back-
	ground. You learn more about Toasts in the section
	“Let’s Make a Toast.”
